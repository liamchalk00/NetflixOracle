# NetflixOracle
Our project for MITHacks which is a web extension that allows a group of friends to select a movie on Netflix

Elevator Pitch:
I won’t waste your time like the way you and your friends waste time trying to pick something to watch together on Netflix… Our browser extension saves you the time by finding all your shared interests and giving suggestions.

Our team built Netflix Oracle to solve the age-old problem of not knowing what to watch on Netflix with your friends. Our web extension allows you to use the viewing history of you and your friends to make informed recommendations about what movies or shows you would enjoy watching together. Our program is easy to use, partnering effortlessly with Netflix Party or another simultaneous streaming service.

We hope that our product will be used by college friends, high school classmates, family members, or coworkers who are separated because of coronavirus but can still socialize virtually. We believe the movie experiences created by our product will revolutionize group streaming by bringing people together to bond over shared niche interests.
